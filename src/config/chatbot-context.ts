## WORKFLOW EXAMPLES

### Credential Issuance Flow:
1. Institution creates credential template
2. Uploads learner data (CSV or manual entry)
3. System generates DIDs and blockchain records
4. Credentials issued with QR codes
5. Learners receive credentials in their wallet
6. PDFs generated and stored in blob storage

### Credential Verification Flow:
1. Employer scans QR code from credential
2. System decodes QR and retrieves blockchain hash
3. Verifies credential on blockchain
4. Displays credential details and verification status
5. Shows issuer information and timestamp

### KYC Flow:
1. User uploads identity documents
2. OCR extracts information from documents
3. System validates extracted data
4. Admin reviews and approves KYC
5. User receives verified status

## SECURITY FEATURES:
- JWT-based authentication with secure token management
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Blockchain immutability for credential integrity
- Secure file storage with Azure Blob Storage
- API rate limiting and CORS protection
- Middleware for request validation

## COMMON REQUEST/RESPONSE EXAMPLES:

### Login Request:
POST /api/v1/auth/login
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword"
}
Response: { "access_token": "jwt_token", "token_type": "bearer" }

### Share Credential:
POST /api/v1/learner/credentials/share
{
  "credential_id": "cred_123",
  "share_type": "qr_code",
  "scope": "public",
  "expires_in_days": 30
}

### Bulk Credential Upload CSV Format:
learner_email,credential_type,course_name,grade,issue_date
john@example.com,certificate,Machine Learning,A,2024-01-15
jane@example.com,degree,Data Science,A+,2024-01-15

### Search Candidates:
POST /api/v1/employer/search
{
  "skills": ["Python", "Machine Learning"],
  "location": "Mumbai",
  "min_experience": 2,
  "credential_types": ["certificate", "degree"]
}

## COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS:

### Authentication Issues:
- **Token expired**: JWT tokens expire after 24 hours, user needs to login again
- **Invalid credentials**: Check email and password are correct
- **Role mismatch**: User role doesn't have permission for the endpoint
- **Solution**: Verify credentials, check token expiration, ensure correct role assigned

### Credential Verification Issues:
- **QR code unreadable**: Ensure QR code image is clear, good lighting
- **Blockchain verification fails**: Check internet connection, blockchain network status
- **Credential revoked**: Institution may have revoked the credential
- **Hash mismatch**: Credential data has been tampered with
- **Solution**: Re-generate QR code, verify on blockchain explorer, contact issuer

### Upload Issues:
- **File too large**: Maximum file size is 10MB for documents, 5MB for images
- **Invalid format**: Supported formats - CSV (bulk), PDF/JPEG/PNG (documents)
- **CSV format error**: Check column headers match required format
- **Missing required fields**: Ensure all mandatory fields are present
- **Solution**: Compress files, use correct format, validate CSV structure

### API Integration:
- **Missing API key**: Get API key from Institution dashboard > API Keys section
- **Invalid API key**: Key may be revoked or expired, generate new one
- **Rate limiting**: Maximum 100 requests per minute per key
- **CORS errors**: Ensure domain is whitelisted in API settings
- **Solution**: Include "Authorization: Bearer {api_key}" in headers, check rate limits

### Bulk Issuance Issues:
- **Some credentials failed**: Check batch status endpoint for detailed errors
- **Processing taking long**: Large batches (>1000) may take 5-10 minutes
- **Duplicate entries**: System will skip duplicate learner_email entries
- **Solution**: Check batch status, wait for completion, remove duplicates from CSV

### Blockchain Deployment Issues:
- **Transaction pending**: Blockchain confirmation can take 1-2 minutes
- **Gas fees**: Ensure sufficient funds in institution's blockchain wallet
- **Network congestion**: High network traffic may delay transactions
- **Solution**: Wait for confirmation, check wallet balance, retry during low traffic

## HELPFUL TIPS:
- All credentials are stored on blockchain for immutability
- QR codes contain blockchain hash for verification
- Multi-language support available (English, Hindi, Spanish, French, German)
- Accessibility features include text-to-speech and high contrast modes
- Mobile responsive design for all screens
